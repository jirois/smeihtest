## About

SMEIH is a web platform designed to serve as an intermediary between international and local investors both private and government with individual or group wanting to start a small medium  enterprise. We carefully put into consideration possible security hassles that would reduce the integrity of the platform. The platform features an admin, Investors, Business owners and agent platform. The app is featuring blockchain technology to handle the security of transactions(cash flow) in the system

## Why

SMEs are crucial contributor to the economy of any nation, contributing up 60% of the total employment. However 200 million SMEs lack access to affordable financial services and credit. When firms gain access to financial services such as credit and insurance, they can accumulate assets, expand their firms, make more productive investments and create jobs.
